# Uncertainty Firmware Collection

My collection of custom firmwares for the super cool [Olivia Artz Modular Uncertainty](https://oamodular.org/products/uncertainty) Eurorack module. More info also on [Official GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oamodular/uncertainty). Uncertainty is a 2HP open-source platform with 1 CV input and 8 gate outputs. Out of the box it's a stochastic gate processor, but its RP2040 processor and USB-C programming make it perfect for custom firmware development.

## Firmwares created:

| Firmware | Description | Language |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| [clock-divider-multiplier](./clock-divider-multiplier/) | Clock divider/multiplier with ratios: /2, /4, /8, /12, /16, x2, x3, x4 | C++ |
